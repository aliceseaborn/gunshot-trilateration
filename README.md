# Gunshot Trilateration

The challenge for this project is to determine the location of a sound (e.g. gunshot) using a sensor array and a trilateration technique. A buzzer was placed in the middle of three microphones connected to a single microcontroller and a oscilloscope. Using the speed of sound and the time delay between the arrival of the buzzer noise at each sensor, the origin of the sound can be determined. In this case, the scale of the experiment was too small to accurately find the delta t for each sensor. Consequently, the trilateration failed despite using the correct techniques.

This project was completed as a requirement for ECE 301, Discrete-time Signals and Systems, to earn an undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
